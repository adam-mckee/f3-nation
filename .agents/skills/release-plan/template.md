## Overview

{{ONE_TO_THREE_SHORT_PARAGRAPHS: what ships, what is unusual, what to expect mid-release}}

<!-- OPTIONAL (Staging only, when Homepage is in the release): -->

**Homepage has no Staging.** Merging the release PR publishes the Homepage straight to **production** (apps.f3nation.com).

## Who's who

| Role         | What they do                                                                                                                                               | Person                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Release lead | Merges the release PR, runs any database migration, approves Production, and makes the go/no-go call. The only person who deploys or changes the database. | @taterhead247 (Tackle) |
| Monitor      | Watches logs and dashboards, runs the read-only database checks, and runs the test plan                                                                    | @BigGillyStyle (Crash) |

**Slack channel:** `#monorepo`. Announce the start there.

## Stop rule

If anything under **Stop if** happens, post in `#monorepo` and pause. Don't approve any Production deployment. The Release lead and Monitor decide together what to do next, and only the Release lead changes the database.

## Checklist

### Step 0: Before release day

<!-- OPTIONAL (only if there is a migration): -->

- [ ] **Confirm database access.** The Release lead can connect to the {{ENVIRONMENT}} database with migration rights; the Monitor can connect read-only. Owner: Release lead

<!-- Add at most 2 more pre-checks, only if a migration needs one (e.g. a query that must return 0 first). -->

### Step 1: Deploy (~20–30 min)

- [ ] **Announce the start** in `#monorepo`. Owner: Release lead
- [ ] **Merge release PR #{{PR}}.** The deploys start automatically. Owner: Release lead

<!-- Production: replace the item below with "Approve each paused production deploy job and wait for it to finish", and drop "Leave those paused". Watch: every `deploy-prod` job (environment `*-production`) turns green, and each Production service shows a new Ready revision. Stop if: a `deploy-prod` job fails (red). -->

- [ ] **Wait for the deploys to finish** on the [Actions page](https://github.com/F3-Nation/f3-nation/actions). Each app deploys to Staging, then pauses at "waiting for approval" for Production. Leave those paused. Owner: Release lead
  - **Watch** (Monitor): every "deploy-staging" job turns green, and each Cloud Run service shows a new Ready revision (jobs: the job shows the new image; deploying does not run it). Homepage goes straight to GitHub Pages: no staging job, no Cloud Run revision.
  - **Stop if:** a deploy-staging job fails (red).

<!-- OPTIONAL (only if there is a migration): -->
<!-- Production: if Staging's "Expected" line was not "none", move Step 2 before the production approval, unless the migration drops or renames something the old app still uses. State the chosen order in the Overview. -->

### Step 2: Run the database migration (~5 min)

- [ ] **Check out this release** from the repository root. `git status --porcelain` must print nothing; then run `git fetch origin && git switch --detach "$(git log origin/main --grep '^chore: release main (#{{PR}})' --format=%H -n 1)" && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Owner: Release lead
  - **Expected:** `ls packages/db/drizzle/*.sql | tail -n 1` prints `packages/db/drizzle/{{NEWEST_MIGRATION_FILE}}`.
  - **Stop if:** the tree isn't clean, or a different file prints.
- [ ] **Run the migration** from the repository root: `pnpm db:migrate:{{staging or prod}}` (not `pnpm db:migrate:local`, which only migrates a local database). It reads the database login from Secret Manager, checks the checkout's migrations are main's and agree with the database, lists the pending migrations, and asks you to type the database name. Owner: Release lead
  - **Expected:** it lists the migration in `{{NEWEST_MIGRATION_FILE}}` (and any other migrations in this release) as pending, nothing else; lines starting `note:` are informational. Type `{{DATABASE_NAME: f3_staging or f3_prod}}` and it ends with `Done: {{DATABASE_NAME}} is at <that migration>.`
  - **Stop if:** it prints `REFUSED`, or lists a migration this release doesn't include. Don't work around a refusal: post it in `#monorepo` and pause.
- [ ] **Run [the check query](#check-query-after-the-migration).** Every result must match. Owner: Monitor
  - **Expected:** {{WHAT_ERRORS_APPEAR_BETWEEN_DEPLOY_AND_MIGRATION_OR_"none"}}
  - **Stop if:** the migration shows an error, or the check query doesn't match. Retry **once**; if it fails again, stop.
- [ ] **Return to your branch:** `git switch -`. Owner: Release lead

<!-- Production: drop Step 3 and renumber. -->

### Step 3: Create the test plan

- [ ] **Create the Staging test plan** with the `staging-test-plan` agent skill and link it here: #___ Owner: Monitor

### Step 4: Test

<!-- Production: "Repeat the per-app smoke checks from the Staging test plan against the production URLs." -->

- [ ] **Work through the test plan.** Owner: Monitor
  - **Watch** (Monitor): keep the app error logs streaming. Post any new error not on the [known-noise list](#known-noise-ignore-these) in `#monorepo` with the time and what you were doing.

<!-- Production: replace Step 5 with one item: "Announce done in `#monorepo`." Owner: Release lead -->

### Step 5: Let it run, then decide

- [ ] **Let Staging run for 24–48 hours,** checking the app error logs once a day. Owner: Monitor
- [ ] **Go/no-go for Production.** The Release lead posts the decision as a comment. **Go** means every box above is checked and no errors are unexplained. Production then gets its own release-plan issue. Owner: Release lead

---

## If something goes wrong

- **One app (Cloud Run service) misbehaves:** discuss it in `#monorepo` first. If rolling back makes sense, the Release lead sends traffic back to the previous revision: Cloud Run → service → **Revisions** → **Manage traffic** → 100% to the revision before this release.

<!-- OPTIONAL (only if there is a migration): one bullet on how to undo it, linking the migration's own rollback notes if they exist. -->

- **In every case:** don't approve Production.

## Monitoring reference

Opening these needs a Google account with at least viewer access to the project.

<!-- Keep only rows for apps in this release. -->

```

```

#### Known noise (ignore these)

- `api.openapi.handler_error`, only at the rate seen before the release. A new path or a jump in volume is a real error.
- `api.map_revalidate.missing_config`
- Slackbot: `The request was aborted because there was no available instance`

<!-- OPTIONAL (only if there is a migration): -->

## Database queries

For the Monitor. Read-only; run against `f3_staging`. <!-- Production: `f3_prod`. -->

#### Check query: after the migration

```sql
-- {{ONE_LINE_EXPECTATION}}
{{QUERY}}
```
